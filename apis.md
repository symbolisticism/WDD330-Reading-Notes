APIs are meant for creating an interface between two different softwares. In the

plug your electronic devices directly into the wiring in the walls. In the same way, you need an interface between the software you are communicating 
with and the software sending the message in order to be able to exchange information properly.

#Different types of APIs and What They Can Do

There are APIs for all different kinds of things. There are APIs for browsers, servers, drawing, graphics, audio, video, devices, and much more. Many 
popular websites have their own APIs for interfacing with them. Included in these websites are YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, and many other well-known sites. 

#How it Works

APIs work by means of JavaScript objects. JavaScript objects hold the information and the functionality the API needs.

#Events are Common for Handling Changes in State

APIs can rely on events triggered in the code to know when and how to perform various functions.

#Added Security

Some APIs have added security features that improve the overall security of your own operations.
